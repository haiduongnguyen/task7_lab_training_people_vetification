# task7_lab_training_people_vetification

The project in lab training progress.
Just use neural net with numpy, the model has accuracy >90% for human detection.
note : Input image has size 64x64 
Then apply it in the project that do : read video, background subtraction, detect movement then see if it's people or not.

The Layer and Model structure has been show in neural_net.py.
The training process i trained on Google Colab, result of weights and biases is in resource/weight_and_bias_task_7.
The resize is an example of resize image to 64x64 and in gray scale.
The application to video is in video processing.py, sample video in resource.
